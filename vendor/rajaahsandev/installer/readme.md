## Editing

Edit files in this folder. Composer links this directory into `vendor/rajaahsandev/installer`, so changes apply immediately (no `composer update` needed for this package).

## After composer update

If you run `composer update` from the project root, this path package stays installed from this directory. Do not remove the `repositories` entry in the root `composer.json`.
